The command pattern is a powerful pattern when it comes to controlling commands that has been rolled out or commands that has to be rolled back.

In simple terms, command pattern encapsulates the command that is passed from one object to the other. In this case, from a end user using photoshop kinda tool to edit what ever he wishes to but a picture on this case, since there is nothing other than that in my mind right now.
