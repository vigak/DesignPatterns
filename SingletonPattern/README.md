Singleton Pattern - one of the simplest pattern available out there. It is generally not recommended to use a Singleton pattern unless it is really needed. 

Why? 
The Singleton pattern breaks the Single Responsibility Principle of Object Oriented Design. 

How? 
It asks the class to have only one instance of itself, do whatever the class is supposed to do and also, be the global point of access for the Singleton class.
